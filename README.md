This repo is currently under construction and in a rapid population phase.

During this early phase, if you are a DSCoLab member and there are files that
you would like to add:

- If functionality of your files does not yet exist in the repo:
  - Use the standard branch & PR process to add them, but feel free to merge without waiting for review.
- If functionality of your files replicates / adds to something already in the repo:
  - Start a PR where details can be scoped & reviewed with the current code's author.
  - Feel free to start out by just adding your own version of the code and using the PR's space to scope out the path to merging functionalities.
  - Final form should coalesce around a single code path.
