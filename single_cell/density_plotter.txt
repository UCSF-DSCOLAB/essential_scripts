Visualize the density of each cluster over the umap space, wraps
dittoDimHex

Description:

     Visualize the density of each cluster over the umap space, wraps
     dittoDimHex

Usage:

     density_plotter(
       object,
       clustering,
       scale_legend = 3,
       main = clustering,
       data.out = FALSE,
       dont_warn = FALSE,
       split.by = NULL,
       color.var = NULL,
       ...
     )
     
Arguments:

  object: A Seurat or SingleCellExperiment object

clustering: String, the name of the metadata to facet by, especially
          one holding cells' cluster identities. Extra detail: This
          value will be passed to ‘dittoDimHex’ in its ‘split.by’
          argument.

scale_legend: Number, a scale factor for the size of the density
          legend. By default, this legend is expanded to 3x the normal
          legend size in order to be able to reveal the multiple color
          changes in its lower end.

main, data.out, ...: Parameters passed on to ‘dittoDimHex’

dont_warn: Logical. Set to TRUE to block output of ‘color.var’ and
          ‘split.by’ input-related warnings.

split.by: NULL or a Single String giving the name of a additional
          metadata to facet by. Not recommended normally, but not
          blocked as there may be valid use-cases.

color.var: Ignored. Usage of this parameter of ‘dittoDimHex’ changes
          density to be plotted via opacity instead of color, which
          would defeat the entire purpose of this wrapper function.

Value:

     A ggplot object where colored hexagonal bins are used to summarize
     cell density of ‘clustering’-identities across the UMAP (or
     dimensionality reduction) space.

     Alternatively, if ‘data.out=TRUE’, a list containing two slots is
     output: the plot (named 'plot'), and a data.table containing the
     underlying data for target cells (named 'data').

Examples:

     # We'll use the Seurat example dataset for this example
     sobj <- SeuratObject::pbmc_small
     
     # We'll also make use of the fact that dittoSeq allows use of the string
     #  "ident" to refererence the 'Idents(seurat_object)' because Seurat
     #  could change the metadata name sof 'pbmc_small' at any time.
     
     density_plotter(
         sobj,
         "ident" # or the name of your desired clustering metadata
     )
     
     # You make the density legend bigger or smaller by adjusting the
     #  'scale_legend' input.
     density_plotter(sobj, "ident",
         scale_legend = 1
     )
     
     # You can also make use of additional dittoDimHex inputs.
     density_plotter(sobj, "ident",
         bins = 5,
         reduction.use = "pca",
         main = "Cluster Densities on PCA"
     )
     
     # You can also turn off the warning from supplying an extra 'split.by'
     #  argument by adding 'dont_warn = TRUE'.
     density_plotter(sobj, "ident",
         split.by = "groups",
         dont_warn = TRUE)
